    Some say that the meaning of life is something that we actively create and define through our actions and experiences. Others say that the meaning of life can be found by recognizing your own gifts and using them to contribute to the world. This could be by helping friends, playing music, or bringing joy to others. 
    Here are some ways to find meaning in life:
    Learn about happiness
    Let your talents lead you to new opportunities
    Make connections with people who share your interests
    Set challenging but clear goals
    Follow your internal compass when making decisions
    Help others when you can
